C++ JSON parser.

This tool will read and parse files that follow the JSON format. It will store
the JSON objects, arrays, and values into equivalent C++ data structures and
allowing you to access via a C++ API.

Note, this tool is not meant to be a CLI tool, but a library. However, a CLI is
supported, mostly for testing.
